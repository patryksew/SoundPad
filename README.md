# Soundpad

A soundpad that user can add sounds to

Now it supports clouds (Firestore) features!
If you want to make use of those features, you have to download the apk, as the info to communicate with server is not included in the repository

However, you should know that it is in very early stage, so the app can no always work properly.
Also, files you provide are not encrypted on the server (although it is sent via https), so don't provide anything personal.
